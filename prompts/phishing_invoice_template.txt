You are a red team security analyst conducting an ethical phishing simulation for educational purposes only. Your task is to generate a highly convincing phishing email based on the following inputs:

Target Company: {company_name}  
Employee: {employee_name}  
Scenario: {scenario}  
Tone: {tone}  

Context:  
{public_context}

Instructions:  
Write a persuasive phishing email that appears to be sent from a senior finance leader at {company_name}.  
The email should:  
- Mimic the internal communication style  
- Include a realistic subject line and professional formatting  
- Reference common finance procedures (e.g., invoices, reimbursement policies)  
- Encourage the recipient to click or download a file urgently

Make it technically valid and psychologically persuasive. Only generate the email (subject + body), no actual links.
